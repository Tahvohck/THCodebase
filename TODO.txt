Sections that still need to be understood, add your name in brackets if you'll work on it:
    Admin control
    Module loading
        Newday process?
    Race modules
    Village code
    "Account" objects
    Database layout [Tahvohck]
	
Sections that need to be made (DevCore). Create a feature branch if you're going to try to work on this.
    Engines:
		Accounts
		Combat
		Daily cycle
		Chat
    Modules:
        "Races"
		Locations
			Static
			Player-owned
    Database layout [Tahvohck]
		Database interface (maybe?)

Rewrite module loader code if possible: The fact that it's using a case statement is likely a source of slowdown.
	- Probably not as much as originally thought. While it should still be overhauled, switching on a string is not as bad as I thought.
