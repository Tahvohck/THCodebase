### Addendums to the CC-BY-NC-ND license

For the purposes of this document the License Holder is "The Twisted Hub Team" as a grouping of people, with ["Tahvohck"](mailto:Tahvohck@gmail.com) as the primary contact for license questions and exemption requests.  
This documents outlines a series of addendums, primarily exceptions that the license holder may or may not choose to make.  
It should not be considered a legal document, but rather a general guideline.  

#### NonCommercial exemptions: 
* As a general rule, any entity that makes fewer than 3000 USD a month as income from the hosting of this code is exempt from the NonCommercial clause of the CC-BY-NC-ND.
  * This exemption is infectious upwards in any company structure.
  * For example, if Company A owns Companies B and C, the combined income between all three from hosting this code may not exceed this limit. If Company B makes 2000 USD a month, Companies A and C may make no more than 1000 USD a month. If any of the companies in this structure cause the total income to exceed this limit, an explicit exemption must be requested.
